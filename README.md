# Supervised Machine Learning: Will a client take a personal loan?

Last year, Thera bank offered its clients a pesonal loan in order convert its liability clients into personal loan takers while retainig them as depositors.
With the data provided, we implement different supervised machine learning algorithims to predict whether a client will take a personal loan if offered.
We deploy 5 different models, select the best and use it to predict future client behaviour.
We cleaned the data, gathered insights with some graphs, trained our models and deployed the best.
The process can be explored in the accompanying streamlit app where the user (using the left panel) can input his client's characteristics and check if he/she will take a loan if offered.

(In the accompanyinh repository, you can access the python code and data set.)

Enjoy!
